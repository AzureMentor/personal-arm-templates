/***** APPENDIX *****/


scenarios:
  - create a set of resources
    * resources must be accessible outside of the "loop" throughout the bicep file
    * if we allow child resources inside of the parent, we must allow a resource loop there too
    * should work with existing syntax as well (i.e. an array of existing storage accounts)
  - return an array of values for a property in a resource
  - allow you to loop by:
   * loop over a set of numbers
   * loop over an array
   * loop over an array with an index I can reference
  - combine loops and conditions
    * filtering (I should be able to access the iterator)
      - skipping items based on a condition == false
  - looping with nested child resources
