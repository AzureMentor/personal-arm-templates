# Submitting a PR to this repo

Contributions are *very* welcome. If you have a blueprint you want to share with the world, follow these steps:

1. Submit a PR with your blueprint in the unvalidated-samples repo. We'll try to merge these ASAP so people can start to play with them.
2. If you want to move this blueprint to the "validated-samples" folder, include "Request to validate" in the commit somewhere
