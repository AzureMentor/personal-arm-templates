# The blueprints-as-code repo has moved!

As much as I love getting stars for my personal repo, the time has come to make this more official. 

We now have an official azure-blueprints repo located here: https://aka.ms/blueprintsascode

I will still use this for personal experimentation with ARM templates and blueprints, but any updates to blueprints-as-code will happen at the new location.

You can email me at alfran@microsoft.com or tweet at me [@sonofdiesel](https://twitter.com/sonofdiesel) if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Alex
