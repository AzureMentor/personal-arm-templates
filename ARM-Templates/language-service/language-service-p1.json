    P1s - GA
    ETA for Release - September

    0. features parity with current extension
    1. function signature intellisense
        a. including UDFs
        b. hopefully things like resourceId and reference function can be contextual
    2. intellisense for language constructs like copy loop
        a. are there others? or is copy the only/main one?
    3. portal and SDKs can deploy this new template
    4. Expression evaluation using parameter file
    - need "full" ARM validation for this
        * mini-F5 to evaluate only with defaultValues?
    - [OPEN QUESTION] will there be value in validation with round-trip to Azure?
